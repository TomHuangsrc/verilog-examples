To record the usage of cocotb and myhdl for simulation.
For the verilog-uart is from https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-uart, there are both simulation using cocotb and myhdl.
In the tb folder, there are sub-folder named uart_rx/uart_tx. The simulation using cocotb are in these two sub-folder.
In the tb folder, there are some python file which used for myhdl simulation.In win10, I add myhdl.vpi into tb folder, and I modified python to identify the location of myhdl.vpi.

you can compare them and find the difference between cocotb and myhdl.

All the codes, I alreay run them well.
